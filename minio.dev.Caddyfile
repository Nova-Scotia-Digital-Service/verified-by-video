# MinIO proxy server for docker compose development environment
#
# This proxy rewrites the request headers so presigned URLs generated inside the `api` service can be used outside on the host machine.
#
# The `api` service connects to MinIO at `minio:9000` (container-to-container)
# The web browser on the host machine connects to MinIO at `localhost:9000` (host-to-container)
#
# Presigned urls do not work if the request headers (`localhost:9000`) do not match the signature (`minio:9000`).

:9000 {
    route {
        reverse_proxy /* minio:9000 {
            header_up Host "minio:9000"
        }
    }
}
